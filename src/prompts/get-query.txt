The user has provided the following prompt "${user-input}". They would like us to 
provide a link to the official documentation for their prompt. Please provide a string 
containing a prompt you would use to search the web for the relevant documentation. 
Remember - we are looking only for the OFFICIAL documentation and not any third-party
guides, tutorials, or other resources. Using your response, I'll search the web on your
behalf. I will provide you the page of results I find, and we'll go from there.

To reiterate: your response now should be nothing but a single string to search the web with.
Do not include any additional text that you don't want want to be included in the search,
including context on how to perform a search or what the string you are providing is for.

You may include special search operators, such as the "site:" operator, to narrow down the 
search if you are already confident of the domain the documentation is hosted on. Please
only use this operator if you are confident. You will be provided with opportunities to
narrow down your search should your first prompt be insufficient - better safe than sorry.

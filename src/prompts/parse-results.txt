I've search the web with your prompt. Here are the results:

${web-results}

Note that each result is labeled with a number. If any of these web results are what we're looking for,
please respond with the following: "CHOOSE {NUMBER}", where number is the numbered identifier of that result.
For example, if you want to choose the first result, you would respond with "CHOOSE 1". Include nothing else
in your response.

If none of these results are to your satisfaction, and you'd like to try again, please respond with "SEARCH {NEW PROMPT}", 
where {NEW PROMPT} is the string to search the web with. Include nothing else in your response.

If none of these results are to your satisfaction, and you do not have any other prompts, please respond with "GIVE UP".

Be picky! If a webpage isn't the absolute best, do NOT choose it. Instead provide a new prompt that avoids the red herrings.
